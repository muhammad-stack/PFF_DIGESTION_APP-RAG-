# Generative AI Q&A System

This repository contains a Generative AI-powered Q&A system leveraging Google Generative AI and FAISS for efficient document retrieval and question answering. The code reads a PDF document, splits it into chunks, and indexes it with embeddings to facilitate fast, accurate responses to user queries.

## Features

- **Google Generative AI** for answering questions with concise and accurate responses.
- **FAISS Vector Store** to handle document retrieval and indexing.
- **Text Splitting** for handling large documents by chunking for efficient embedding and retrieval.
- **Custom Prompts** for controlled, concise responses to user questions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install langchain langchain_community langchain_google_genai python-dotenv
   ```

3. Configure your environment by adding the necessary API keys to a `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your PDF file in the same directory and update `file_path` to the PDF filename.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python <script_name>.py
   ```
3. The program will prompt you to ask a question. It will fetch relevant information from the PDF and generate a response.

## Code Walkthrough

- **Load Document**: Loads and splits the PDF using `PyPDFLoader` and `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
- **Embedding & Indexing**: Uses Google Generative AI embeddings to index document chunks with FAISS.
- **Question Answering**: The system retrieves context and generates concise answers based on provided prompts.

## Example
